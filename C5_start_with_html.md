_What is HTML! Is it some kind of weird psycho language?_
 
No.HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Link.
HTML is a special type of file.HTML is just like a type of book.There are many different type of books.E.g. Fables,Biography,Cartoons etc.
HTML is a computer language which is used to create your own website. 

Normally,we "open" HTML using Internet Browser.Some examples of Internet Browser are Google Chrome,Internet Explorer,Safari, Mozilla Firefox .etc.
But,when we want to "create" we can use text editor like TextMate, Notepad etc.

Now,let us start creating our very own webpage!
HTML is a special type of file. Just like a fable, biography are special types of book.

Let's start with creating an HTML file -- ITkid.html

Remember

- start with <html> and with </html>


#PRACTICE:

- [x] Open textmate or any other text editor and start with:

```
 <html>

```
- [x] Always remember to start with:

```
<html>
<head>

```
- [x] Just remember HTML as a human.It must always start from the top which is the head.

```
<title>Page title.</title>

```
- [x] A website must always have a title.

```
</head>

```
- [x] Remember if whatever has a bracket it must always close.E.g:

```
Examples: </html> , </head> , </title> , </body>

```
- [x] After the head comes the body.

```
<h1>This is a Heading</h1>

```
- [x] Next is the heading always remember to type :

```
<h1>and after typing the title in between type </h1>
</body>
</html>
