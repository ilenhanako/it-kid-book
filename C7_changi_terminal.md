#Chapter 7: Changi Terminal
_What is terminal in my MacBook? Are there any planes in my MacBook?_

Unfortunately not. But why we call it terminal?

Because same as Changi, in Terminal, an application (aeroplane) takes off.

This morning, Adelaine is the pilot of an aeroplane called TextMate.
She drove it off by typing "mate ."

Before she acts as pilot, Adelaine must work as an aeroplane engineer. She is the lonely ranger!

What is an aeroplane engineer doing?
She check whether the wheel is working perfectly (so that her flight does not crash).

In her macbook, she need to find the correct folder by using "cd command". She is also now familiar with "pwd", "ls", "ls -l", tab (a shortcut so that she is no longer a slow cat)

## Tasks
- [ ] Open terminal
- [ ] Go to the correct folder (aeroplane engineer), use cd command
- [ ] Once you're in the right folder, double check it, use pwd command
- [ ] Type mate .
