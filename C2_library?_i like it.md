#Chapter 2 : Library? I like it!

When you go to library, you would see different sections, children section, fiction section, or IT section. Within the section, for example children section you would see different rack for e.g. baby rack, pre-teen rack, teenager rack. And within a rack you would see the actual books.

What’s the purpose of having section and rack? Imagine if a librarian just dump all of the books in a big room. How would you find your favorite book like Geronimo Stilton among millions of  other books that the library has?

Imagine a computer is just a library.The books is the heart of the library. The heart of a computer is  called file. There are thousands of files within a computer. Thus, they are not dumped in a big room. Instead of that, each file is stored within a folder. 

_I guess you meant rack?_
Yes, you got it. Folder is like a rack in a library.

_And what about the library section?_
Section is also comparable to a folder, but a rather “big” folder. So a “big” folder can contain folders. Just like a section contains multiple racks. 

#PRACTICE 1:
- [x]Open terminal
- [x]Go to root folder. Root? Just like root of the tree is the starting point. Root folder is the master , biggest folder. 
 Command: **cd/**

- [x]Find what folders inside root
 Command: **Is**

- [x]Go to one of the folders i.e. Users
 Command: **cd Users**



Find out what is inside Users. Where is the file?
                             
Let’s go to the heart of a library called book, it has many kinds of books. 
Similarly, you’re going to find many kinds of files in a computer.

1. Image files , those files are actually images. Drawing!

2. Video files, those files are actually videos. You meant youtube? Hmm yes and no. Youtube is not a file, but youtube let you enjoy video files by watching it

3. Text file, those files are not fun. Just like a book without picture. It contains only text or alphabets. OK papa, let’s skip it.
