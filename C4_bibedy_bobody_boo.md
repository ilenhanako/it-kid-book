#Chapter 4 : “Bibedy Bobody Boo!”

File in a computer, is just like a book for a library.
Now we are going to be a book author, oh well, I meant file author. 

_Oh! what kind of file are we going to create? You told me there are few kinds of file like image file, video file or the boring text file?_


Well, to avoid boringness virus we will start with creating image and video file. What you need to do now is open PhotoBooth application, dress up yourself and shoot a photo or video. The photo and video that you’re going to capture will be stored in a file. For photo, the file extension is jpeg for e.g. my_photo.jpeg , for video the file will have mov extension, it is something like my_video.mov.


_What is file extension ,papa?_


Without file extension you will call your photo as my_photo instead of my_photo.jpeg. 


_Isn’t it more simple to call it just my_photo?_

Yes it is.

But remember, we have thousands of file in your computer. You may get confused to differentiate which ones are image file or video file or text file or many other type files. Especially your computer needs to know which app to use in order to open a file. Image editor can only open image file, but not text file. 

This is the role of extension.
