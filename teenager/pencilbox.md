# Pencil Box, my Storage

Storage is crucial in our daily life.
Why? Because when you're not storing it, then it will disappear in no time.

In programming, storage is very important.
When you put your images to Google Photos, google help to store your photos in their machine, so that you could see them again in future.
When you save your money to the bank, the bank system will update (store!!) your saving balance, so that your money is not gone, and you could withdraw whenever needed.

So now, you have your registration page. Somebody go to your website, enter the form, and click Save!
How would you store the information, so that Papa could retrieve those again?
