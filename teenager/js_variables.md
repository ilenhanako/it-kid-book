# JavaScript variables
In JavaScript we could define multiple types of variables.
All depends on the needs.

If you need to store water, you need a glass. But when you store cookies, you need a jar.
In programming, when you need to store `alphanumeric` / `a-zA-Z1..9` --> String

```
var adelaine = ilen;
```
In programming, just like in algebra, we use variables (like adelaine) to hold values.
:bulb:JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values.
Variables are declared with the __var__ keyword

## String
The String object lets you work with a series of characters
__Strings__ of text e.g. "This text string" etc.
```
var adelaine = ilen;
```
The String() function converts the value of an object (like ilen) to a string.
String varaibles are normally alphabets

## Numeric
__Numeric__, eg. 123, 120.50 etc.

For instance, you might create a variable named money and assign the value 2000.50 to it.

```
var money = 2000.50
```
The difference between numeric variables and string variables is that the numeric uses numerical values(numbers) and string uses alphabets

## JSON
Life is not as simple as you think of (that's why you should not make matter more difficult).
But in programming sometime you could not avoid the complexity. A value might not just be a number nor alphabet. Instead of that it could be multiple value, and possibly nested.
Thank you to Mr.Douglas - he invented a not so complex solution for complex values. It called as JSON.
