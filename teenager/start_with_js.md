# JavaScript Getting Started

Let's start with a _reflection_.
We began with HTML page.
We made the page prettier, by putting `style`
More and more styles, mushrooming styles.
But it is not hygienic. So we plucked out all the style, and put in CSS file.
We replaced the style with simple `class`
So we get, a nice and clean page.
But it is so boring. It is not moving, no animation, no business!
I want it more functional. When you click a button, it should shout or turn upside down.
This is where I need a JavaScript. Yay!
