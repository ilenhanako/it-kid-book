# JavaScript Getting Started

Let's start with a _reflection_.
We began with HTML page.
We made the page prettier, by putting `style`
More and more styles, mushrooming styles.
But it is not hygienic. So we plucked out all the styles, and put them in CSS file.
We replaced the `style` with simple `class`
So we get, a nice and clean page :heart:
But it is so boring. It is not moving, no animation, no business!
I want it more functional. When you click a button, it should shout or turn the page upside down.
This is where I need a JavaScript. Yay!:sparkles:



## Simple JavaScript Command
An example of a simple Javascript command.

```javascript
alert('how are you?')
```

_alert ?_ What is that? An alert is a pop up. _how are you?_ is a example name or quote that you want to show in your popup.
Try making your own pop up now!

## How to add JavaScript?
In HTML, the opening tag for HTML is '<html>' aand its closing tag is '</html>'
_RECALL: What is a tag? _

JavaScript commands are placed within `<script>` and `</script>`. In short, it is within script tag.
The above example(alert pop up) must be enclosed within `script tag`. 

## How to test?
- [ ] Use Console inside Google Chrome Developer toolbar
- [ ] Update directly the HTML code

## JavaScript function
When papa ask you to help for chores, he will command

1. sweep the floor
2. wash the cloth
3. fold your blanket
4. fold the clothes
5. bla bla bla (the list is too long)

But papa is so efficient, instead of saying out all those commands, he just said `do chores`, and kid is expected to do all these long list.
His efficiency is a learning from JavaScript function. Instead of typing all those command one by one, everytime it is needed ~ he wrote a JavaScript function and name it as `do_chores`. Anytime he want it to happen, he will `execute` by calling `do_chores()`
