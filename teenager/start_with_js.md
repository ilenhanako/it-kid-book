# JavaScript Getting Started

Let's start with a _reflection_.
We began with HTML page.
We made the page prettier, by putting `style`
More and more styles, mushrooming styles.
But it is not hygienic. So we plucked out all the styles, and put them in CSS file.
We replaced the `style` with simple `class`
So we get, a nice and clean page :heart:
But it is so boring. It is not moving, no animation, no business!
I want it more functional. When you click a button, it should shout or turn the page upside down.
This is where I need a JavaScript. Yay!:sparkles:



## Simple JavaScript Command
An example of a simple Javascript command.

```javascript
alert('how are you?')
```

_alert ?_ What is that? An alert is a pop up. _how are you?_ is a example name or quote that you want to show in your popup.
Try making your own pop up now!

## How to add JavaScript?
In HTML, the opening tag for HTML is '<html>' aand its closing tag is '</html>'
_RECALL: What is a tag? _

JavaScript commands are placed within `<script>` and `</script>`. In short, it is within script tag.
The above example(alert pop up) must be enclosed within `script tag`. 

## How to test?
- [ ] Use Console inside Google Chrome Developer toolbar
- [ ] Update directly the HTML code

## JavaScript function
