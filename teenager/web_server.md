# Web Server, The Mighty Server

What is server?
Somebody or something that _serve_ you.
In programming, server refers to the big computer in the data room, or to a specific application that serve you.
So it is either hardware or software.

This time, we will discuss on software-like server. E.g. of server i.e. mail-server , web-server, ftp-server.
This time, we will discuss only on web-server.

Web server is the mighty server behind each WWW URL. So when you open www.mighty.com , then there is a web server behind mighty.com.

In ilen.herokuapp.com , you craft your HTML in your MacBook (index.html), and send it over to heroku server. Then _web server_ in Heroku will return the _exactly same_ index.html to whoever call ilen.herokuapp.com
