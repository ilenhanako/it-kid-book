Papa "IT Kid" already learnt Microsoft Office, Excel, and PowerPoint at school.

Too bad that Papa's MacBook does not have Microsoft Office. It would need almost 200$ extra to have this :(
And Papa said, we could not prolong our fasting. Our body is deteriorating.

Thank you to "Google Doc", we could do similar thing for FREE!! Yiha! Huh Adelaine the cheapster!
