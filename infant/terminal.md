#Changi Terminal
Today we will explore about a special application in your computer , called **Terminal**

_What is terminal in my MacBook? Are there any planes in my MacBook?_

Unfortunately not.

_Why do we call it terminal?_

Because same as Changi, in Terminal, an application (aeroplane) takes off.

For example: You are the pilot of an aeroplane called TextMate.
You drove it off by typing "mate ."

Before you act as a pilot, you must work as an aeroplane engineer.Like a lonely ranger!

_What does an aeroplane engineer do?_
An aeroplane engineer checks whether the wheel is working perfectly (so that his or her flight does not crash).

In your macbook, you need to find the correct folder by using "cd command". You are also familiar now with "pwd", "ls", "ls -l" and "tab" (a shortcut so that you are no longer a slow cat)

_Hey! I am not a slow cat!_

## Practice
- [ ] Open terminal
- [ ] Go to the correct folder (aeroplane engineer), use cd command
- [ ] Once you're in the right folder, double check it, use pwd command
- [ ] Type mate .
