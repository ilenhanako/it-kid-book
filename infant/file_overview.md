# What Infant Should Know? File ...

Library has lots of books. A book in a library is similar to a file within your computer.

Book has a title, e.g. "Alice in Wonderland". File too. You could have file with name "itkid.txt"

## Types of File
There are few different book's genre like comic, fairytales. Same with file too. You have different types like "image" file, "video" file, "text" file or many others. Adelaine's favourite book is non-fiction type.
Adelaine's favourite file type is JPEG, why? Because JPEG file, are files that keeping photos!

## Delete a File
Naughty baby can destroy a book. File can also be deleted.

## Transfer a File
Generous kid can donate book to others. I also can send file to others.
But there is a bit of difference here.
When I send file to others, I still have the copy
When I give book to others, I lost it (cry cry cry)

## Folder
Books in library is placed in rack. Same with files too. Files are placed in folder. Some people call it , directory.
