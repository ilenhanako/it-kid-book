file -- imagine a book inside library, file is like one book inside your computer


book has title -- file has a name e.g. ilenku.docx
book has category e.g comic, fairytales -- file has extension / type e.g. docx, pptx, txt, jpeg
book has a rack (so that Adelaine can easily search her favourite reading) -- file has a folder

I can destroy a book (if getting crazy) -- file can also be deleted.

I can give book to other -- I also can send file to others
* when I send file to others, I still have the copy
* when I give book to others, I lost it hua hua hua

Adelaine's favourite book is non-fiction type.
Adelaine's favourite file type is JPEG, why? Because JPEG file, are files that keeping photos!
