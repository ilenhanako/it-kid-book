#Chapter 3 : Bob the Builder!

_Bob the Builder? Is he an app maker?_

He is almost like an app maker. But he builds buildings and meanwhile app maker builds apps. Bob the Builder needs a lot of tools to build a building. For example

 1.a saw
 2.hammer
 3.torch
 4.helmet.
etc.

Similarly, in making an app, you also need to have the right tools. There are many tools you need to master.

1.Computer. It should be light, portable and quick. You need to work anytime and anywhere. Your computer should not hold you back for a minute or more to start or close it. Waiting game is a painful one (although it teach you to be more patient).

2.Terminal.  Terminal is actually an app. It comes out of the box when you buy a computer.

3.Text Editor. Text editor is an app used to edit your text file. There are many kinds of text editor. The good one should automatically color your text. Color will make your life more colorful, right? I would recommend you to use TextMate or Sublime

4.Image Editor. Image editor is similar to text editor, but it is use to edit image files, like photos or your cartoon drawings. 

5.Internet Browser.  Internet Browser is like a window in your PC to a bigger world called internet.

_Cool !!!_
