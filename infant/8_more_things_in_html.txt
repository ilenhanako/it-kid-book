IT Kid already learnt HTML on lesson 4.

What do you remember?
* It stands for HyperText Markup Language
* I created HTML using TextMate
    - create a file with type html
    - it starts with <html> tag
    - it ends with </html> tag
    - whatever you are going to add must be within <body> and </body>
    - I also learnt few other tags, such as: title, h1, h2, img, a
    - I also learnt about tag attributes
    - What is tag attributes? If tag is ILEN, tag attributes are color skin, hobby, hairstyle -- to be precise here is
    <ILEN colorskin="blue" hairstyle="botak"></ILEN>

* I open HTML using Internet Browser -- Google Chrome
