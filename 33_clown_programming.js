Clown programming? Are you kidding me , clown?

I heard about JavaScript programming, It is a programming with JavaScript language.
I heard about Ruby programming, It is a programming with Ruby language.

Are you telling that there is a programme done with Clown language?

No .. no .. no ..

Clown here is just an illustration.

A clown has many things in the outer side of him or her
* clown t-shirt
* clown nose
* clown make up
* clown shoes
* clown hair

But a clown also has its own behaviour or ability like
* joking
* dancing
* gymnastic
* doing silly movements

If the clown is a website, then
* the "look and feel" or "appearance" of the website is the same as the outer side of the clown. And if the clown using special t-shirt, nose, shoes, etc -- then the website is using style or CSS to accomplish those appearances.

* the "behaviour" or "ability" of a website is the responsiblity of JavaScript.

So there is inner part & outer part of the website, as well as Clown.

INEN already learnt both CSS & JavaScript. But today she will see the combine power of both (just like WINX CLUB).
