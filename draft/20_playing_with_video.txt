What is video?

Video is "moving" pictures.

So it is basically many (not moving) pictures, that you see one after another -- very fast -- so that your eyes and subsequently your brain got deceived (impressed as if it is moving picture).

What's your favourite website to see Video? www.youtube.com
Is there any other websites displaying Video? www.stomp.com , www.vimeo.com

Who created the video in the website? Public (not website owner).

Back to Samselin's mastercraft. She is very sad because her website is "static" -- no animation, no moving picture, no sound.. 

So today, we will make it impressive by adding video.

Ok, we will not create video ourselves, we will just display video from youtube.
