IT Kid papa is writing a top secret future project proposal for his beloved daughter.
This project nick name is FreeDr. 

IT Kid want him to share the project to her MacBook. But papa is getting confused. How would he be able to improve the proposal easily ~ without depending on pinky MacBook?

Oh yea, let's try Google Doc.

1. Papa will copy the proposal in Google Doc -done
2. Papa will then share the "proposal" to IT Kid in Google Doc. -done

Let's do it!!!
