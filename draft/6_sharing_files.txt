Adelaine, are you sharing book with your friends? Yes sometimes.

Adelaine, do you borrow books from library? Yeah, very a lot. My favorite is Percy Jackson.

In computer world , books = files.

E.g. you have a video file "puppy eating watermelon", how do you share to your best friend?
* send it through WhatsApp
* send it using email

Do you have email address? No. Let's create one.
How to create email address?
* @gmail -- use www.gmail.com -- from Google
* @yahoo -- use www.yahoo.com -- from Yahoo

So Adelaine is experimenting sharing files with her daddy by email, after she created a gmail account. Yihaa!
