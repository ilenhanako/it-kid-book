Have you ever ride a bus? Yeah, of course, you think nobody did (Mind your words, little girl).

Have you ever heard about "local" bus? No.
Do you know what is local? Yes. I know local people, local food.
What does it mean by local?

You never heard about "local" bus, because you're staying in Singapore.
So, everything here is in one city, and it is always "local".

When you go to Indonesia, there is "local" bus, there is "inter-local" bus.
The same thing when you go to public phone -- you can make "local" phone call, and "inter-local" phone call.


Local means "in your neighbourhood". 

So in computer, sometime master will say "local file" or "remote file". Remote means distant.

Local file means the file is inside your computer (most likely is in your harddisk).
Remote file means the file is outside of your computer, e.g. if the file is in the internet.

* Experience with remote file -- DONE
* Experience with local file 

--- HARDDISK

harddisk is just a file storage, just like a book rack for a book.
there are many different size of book rack
* let me call the biggest one as "library"
* second biggest as "library section"
* third biggest as "library bookshelf"
--> a library contain a few or a lot of library sections
--> a library section contains a few or a lot of libary bookshelves

in computer world -- let's call the library as "root" folder. root folder is defined by symbol "/"

Inside the root, there is first level folder (same with library section), e.g. Users, Library, Application folder.
All files inside harddisk is local file.
