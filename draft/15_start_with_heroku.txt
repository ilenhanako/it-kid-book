wow! papa can't wait to teach his beloved naughty dr about heroku.
why? heroku is such an excellent piece of work.

enough talk, 

1. let's create a heroku account.
DONE.

2. install Heroku Toolbelt

After I install heroku toolbelt,I could run heroku command in terminal.

3.Try with various heroku command. 
* heroku login
* heroku create

4. Then we created a website project. I have my first website now called
http://ilen.heroku.com

* I create my website locally ~ using TextMate, and tested using Google Chrome
* Then I push the update to heroku by running following command
=> git add -A
=> git status (is optional -- only for me to see the changes)
=> git commit -m 'any message'
=> git push heroku (this is the real command to push out the changes to heroku)
