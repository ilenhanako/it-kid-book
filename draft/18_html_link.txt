Just like a Padang food, without chilli. That's IT Kid's first web page.

Chilly is one of main ingredient for Padang food.
What is one of missing ingredient in IT Kid's website?

Hyperlink!

HTML is very common to have hyperlink inside. Just imagine hyperlink as "Citilink" than connecting "CityHall" and "Suntec".

Hyperlink exist in a page to connect to "any other" pages or website.

Let's try it.

She added link to google by putting below code
	<a href="http://www.google.com">Link To Google</a>

Can we add link to our own other page? Yes, of course.

ITKid created second HTML page, and also create a "hyperlink" from the first page to the second page.
