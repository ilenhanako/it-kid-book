#Who Likes Your Toys?

When you have a toy, you might want to know how popular it is. How many people like your toys, whether those who like your toys are adult or children and so on and so forth.

This time your toy is your heroku app. You have your website, how would you know how many people are using it, how many are opening it from mobile or computers, from which countries they are, and so on and so forth.

How would you do that?

_I don't know. But we could ask Uncle Google_

Before you ask, you need to know the _keyword_ i.e. analytic. Let me answer on behalf of Uncle. The answer is to use _Google Analytic_

## Tasks
- [ ] Go to google analytic website. Not sure the link? Find it!
- [ ] Login with your google account
- [ ] Read the guideline (you would find it after login). Basically you would need to copy a __text__
- [ ] Paste the __text__ to your web page. And upload your page
- [ ] Anytime in future, go back to google analytic. There you would see __how likes your toys__
