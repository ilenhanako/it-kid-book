I start to be more familiar with HTML.
And i am a little hacker now.
I want to do a lot of things with my first website.

I noticed one magic word inside HTML, that i used a lot to beautify
my website that is style.

Using style , i could do
* Change font color
* Change background color

Papa said there are many many more things i could do with HTML style.
The best way to learn this is by asking the question to Uncle Google. 
Let me try it now!
