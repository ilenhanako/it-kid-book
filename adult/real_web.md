# Real Web Application with Node.JS

Up till today, we created the HTMLs in our local and push them to "web server".
Instead of preparing the HTMLs in advance, we will ask "help" from "our assistant" to prepare the HTMLs.

_Who is our assistant?_
He / she is not human, instead _our assistant_ could be Ruby script, Java, Phython, Node.JS ... 
Our assistant will be responsible to create the HTML we wants.

_Why do we need those assistants?_
Because we don't have time to create 1000 HTMLs for 1000 pages of song lyrics. We just need to create one or few Ruby / Phython / Node.JS script to create 5000 pages of _song lyrics_.
Isn't that cool?

_How do we start?_
We can't learn all those languages in short time. Let's pick state of the art solution i.e. Node.JS.
Let's start with practice!
