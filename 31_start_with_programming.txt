I thought I have learnt programming? Like HTML, CSS, GIT, etc.

Well, you have not even learnt a real programming language.

Do you like painting? Yes.
How did you paint? Yeah I tried various way of painting like using pencil, crayon, water colour, paint colour, etc. 

Just like painting, there are few different ways of doing programming. Each is differentiated by programming "LANGUAGE". 

Just like an artist, who usually capable of more than one way of paintings.
Similarly, a senior programmer may have learnt few different of programming languages. Example of programming languages: Ruby, Java, JavaScript, C#.

Today, you will learnt my favorite programming language, called JavaScript. Well, it is not a "kid-level" programming. In fact, JavaScript is used heavily by Google in developing Google Doc, or by FaceBook in developing FaceBook website.

The lesson today is a foundation for you to be like Mack Z or "papa".

Enough introduction, let's go to the meat of the lesson.

-- Just like a drawing, you need to have a blank paper or canvas, as the playground. So in JavaScript programming, we will use Google Dev Toolbar (as part of Chrome browser) -- console Tab.

ilen = "good";
papa = "better";
ilen + papa = "goodbetter";

ilen = "naughty"

=== VARIABLE ===
ilen & papa is called as "variable". What is variable?
variable, root word is "vary" -- meaning few different things

so why ilen & papa called variable? because we can set ilen as "good", but we also can re-set it again as "naughty". so ilen value is changing.

how about "good" and "better"? they are called as variable's value.

so that's TOO EASY. why papa need to do hours of working for such an easy things!!!

continue ...

=== VARIABLE TYPE ===

there are few different types of variables. in samples above, ilen , papa are String variable. Meaning the variable contains String's value. What's String? Don't get me confused! Easy answer: ask Uncle Google!

String is sequence of characters e.g. "good" is sequence of "g", "o", "o", "d"

What other type of variables? Integer is just like a number!

=== VARIABLE ASSIGNMENT ===
