# Popular Kid
Ruth, is there any popular girl in your class?

_There is no one popular in my class unless you are talking about the girl who picks her nose._

The girl is popular because many others may talk about her. Similarly with your website. Your website is popular if many other website 'talk' about yours.

_How can a website talk?_
I could just add your hyperlink (the address of a website e.g https.//hello.com) in my website. So that your website will gain __a bit__ of popularity.

_A bit only? How to make it a lot more popular?_
Sadly, yes it is a bit. The reason there is not many visitors in papa's website. So if I add your link, you may just gain a bit more visitors (coming from my website).
The best thing is if a search engine website like Google will talk a lot about yours. __Google has a lot of visitors__ 

_Ok, how do we start to ask Google to recognize my website?
