Please read again your problem in previous lesson. Papa promised an easy solution.

The solution is using an app called "git". Do you know who created this "git" in the beginning?

"git" is the brainchild of Linus Trovald. Once upon a time, when Bill Gates was the most popular IT kid in the world ~ Linus is told to be more popular.

Let's check about him in Wikipedia. Let me do , let me do!!! (IT Kid shouted)

IT Kid happily read about Linus, one of the geek in Computer world.

She also installed one of his brainchild i.e. git.

So that in "terminal", now she can call git command.

Now back to the problem, how can "git" helqp her?

CONCLUSION:
Samselin wrote few chapters. After writing each day she committed the work into gid by running below command

git add -A
git status
git commit -m 'any commit message'


And then papa deleted all the files. And Samselin was able to restore it by

git checkout -- filename
