# Back To Reality
You created a dummy project. In this chapter, you will be back to reality.

_Reality? What is that?_

That means it will be a real project. And you did it before, do you remember about Heroku thingy?

_Yes_

So this time, you will create another heroku project with 1 simple HTML, and push it not only to heroku, but also to github.

#Tasks
Here is what you need to do

- [x] Create a project folder in your computer
- [x] Create an HTML file inside the folder. Name it as index.html
- [x] Using terminal, you mark your project as Heroku project. If you forgot the steps, please look at past lesson on this.
- [x] Push your project to Heroku repository (using git push heroku)
- [x] Push your project to Github.com repository (you need to create github.com repository first before that)
