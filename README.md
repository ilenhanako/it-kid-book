#Everyone Can Code

Professional dancer, Carlos, once said everyone can dance. 
With the same spirit, everyone can code. Even Kids!

We'll use parables here and there, to help us understand foreign concept. We're going to learn latest technology that used by passionate developers, such as github, heroku, javascript, CSS, or even fly a drone. 

This is a working document that will be kept updated, a learning journey for both Ruth and papa.
