#Everyone Can Code

Professional dancer, :dancer: Carlos :dancer:, once said _everyone can dance_. 
With the same spirit, everyone can code. Even Kids :two_men_holding_hands:!

We'll use `parables` here and there, to help us understand foreign concept. We're going to learn _latest technology_ that used by passionate developers, such as `github`, `heroku`, `javascript`, `CSS`, or even how to fly a `drone`. 

This is a working document that will be kept updated, a learning journey for both Ruth and papa.
