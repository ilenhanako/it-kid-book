HTML is a special type of file. Just like a fable, biography are special types of book.

What is HTML?

- normally we "open" HTML using Internet Browser (Google Chrome, FireFox, Internet Explorer, Safari)
- but when we want to "create" we can use text editor like TextMate, Notepad
- Netscape + Internet Explorer
